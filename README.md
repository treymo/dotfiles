Dotfiles for the essentials

## Installation
1. Make sure the latest `vim` version is installed with Python support. This
   usually isn't the one in the system package manager.
1. Install the syntastic checkers referenced in `vimrc`. 'flake8', for example.
1. Launch vim and run :BundleInstall after launch to install all plugins.
1. Install the powerline fonts to make vim and tmux look pretty. https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/master/installation/linux.html
1. In tmux, execute `<prefix> + I` to install the tpm managed plugins.
